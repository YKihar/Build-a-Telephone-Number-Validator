# Telephone Number Validator

## Project Description

This web application validates telephone numbers based on North American Numbering Plan (NANPA) rules.  It was built to practice and demonstrate skills in JavaScript, particularly regular expressions, for validating user input.  This project focuses on front-end development and provides a practical example of data validation in web forms.

## Key Features

*   **Telephone Number Validation:**  Users can input a telephone number, and the application will determine if it's a valid NANPA format.
*   **Clear Feedback:** The application provides clear and concise feedback to the user, indicating whether the number is valid or invalid, and if invalid, potentially why.
*   **NANPA Compliant:** The validation adheres to the specific rules of the North American Numbering Plan, including area codes, exchange codes, and subscriber numbers.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**  The interface is designed for ease of use, making it simple for users to understand and interact with the validation process.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript (Regular Expressions)
